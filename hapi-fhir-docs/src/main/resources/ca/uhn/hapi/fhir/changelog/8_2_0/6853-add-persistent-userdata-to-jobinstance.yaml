title: "A `Map<String, Object>` called `userData` has been added to the `JobInstance` model class. User data
that is added to the `JobInstance` via the `STORAGE_PRESTORAGE_BATCH_JOB_CREATE` pointcut will be serialized 
and persisted as a new attribute of the `Batch2JobInstanceEntity` called `myUserDataJson`. 
This data will be deserialized and available on the `JobInstance` parameters of the Batch2 `WorkChunk` pointcuts 
(`BATCH2_CHUNK_PRE_PROCESSED`, `BATCH2_CHUNK_PROCESSING_COMPLETED`, `BATCH2_CHUNK_PROCESSING_COMPLETED_NORMALLY`, 
`BATCH2_CHUNK_PROCESSING_COMPLETED_HANDLE_EXCEPTION`)."
